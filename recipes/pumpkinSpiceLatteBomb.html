        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Inspired by cocoa bombs, these latte bombs 
            are loaded with instant coffee and pumpkin pie spice on the inside for a fun DIY latte. 
            The white chocolate sweetens the coffee perfectly â€” just add a dollop of whipped cream 
            and sprinkle with pumpkin pie spice (or a drizzle of caramel) for the ideal latte consistency.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 ounces white chocolate, divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons French vanilla instant coffee</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
            <li>4 drops orange food coloring</li>
            <li>6 cups hot brewed coffee</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Break 4 ounces of the white chocolate into small pieces and place in a medium microwave-safe bowl; 
                microwave on HIGH, stirring at 30-second intervals, until melted, about 1 1/2 minutes. 
                Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the melted chocolate into each of 6 (1 3/4-inch) silicone ball molds. 
                Immediately flip mold over onto a cutting board or plate to allow chocolate to drip off and coat the mold. 
                Let stand 2 minutes. Flip back over and use an offset spatula to scrape the tops of molds to clean them off, 
                placing any dripped chocolate back into the bowl. Place silicone mold in freezer to set, about 5 minutes. 
                Release chocolate "cups" from silicone molds; set aside. Repeat with another 4 ounces of chocolate. </li>
            <li>While the molds chill, stir together beverage mix and pumpkin pie spice in a small bowl. 
                Spoon 2 teaspoons of the mixture into 6 of the "cups." </li>
            <li>Place the bowl of the leftover melted chocolate back in the microwave; 
                microwave on HIGH until melted, about 30 seconds. 
                Spoon or pour into a small zip-top plastic bag or piping bag and snip off 1/16-inch of the corner. 
                Pipe a thin chocolate line along the edge of the 6 filled white chocolate cups. 
                Place remaining 6 cups on top, using the white chocolate line as glue. 
                Smooth out with your finger, and gently place in silicone mold; freeze until set, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove the balls from freezer, and dip an offset spatula in very hot water; use it to smooth out edges of the chocolate ball seam. 
                Set aside. </li>
            <li>Break remaining 2 ounces of chocolate into pieces, and place in a small microwave-safe bowl; 
                microwave on HIGH until melted, about 30 seconds. Add food coloring, and stir to combine. 
                Place in a separate ziplock bag and snip off 1/16-inch from a corner. 
                Pipe in a zig-zag pattern on the balls. Freeze until set, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>To serve, brew an 8- to 10-ounce cup of your favorite coffee. 
                Place a bomb in the hot cup of coffee and stir to melt. </li>    
        </ol>
